# Settings for SASS

instead to use the tools on vs code I have decied to use "package.json" 
in this way I can run things on the terminal without relies on therd party tools

remeber to: 
 - [ ] have a package.json
 - [ ] add the required dependencies
 - [ ] configure the scripts in package.json
 - [ ] install the required dependencies by running `npm install`
 - [ ] run the desired tasks using npm scripts
